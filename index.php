	<h1>Welcome to Custom Container Homes</h1>

	<p>There is a rapidly growing trend, worldwide, in which people are downsizing their living space. There are a number of reasons, from significantly lower building costs, to a simpler lifestyle, or to a more efficient use of space.</p>

	<p>At Custom Container Homes, we specialize in low cost custom kits that convert shipping container into homes, offices, and cabins.</p>

	<p>We have several plans, from a single basic container, to multiple containers side by side.</p>

	<p>Our specialty in container homes is our modular concept -- offering a kitchen, bathroom, or bedroom that slides out upon installation increasing the square footage.</p>

	<p>You have the freedom to design your own floor plan tailored to your specific needs. There are a variety of choices.</p>

	<p>Based in Northern Arizona, there are several freight options to most locations. As containers they are transportable without the need for permits and they are road legal at 8 feet wide.</p>

	<h2>Why use shipping containers?</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>They are strong, steel, and "eco-friendly" green.</li>
		<li>An expensive concrete slab is not required.</li>
		<li>You get steel building material for much less than for a similar wood framed home.</li>
		<li>Enjoy the industrial look or enhance them with sidings of your choice.</li>
		<li>Container homes are perfect for today's varied locations.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>We are competitive</h2>

	<p>We keep the cost of converting affordable by selling them in kits in several stages of completion or as a finished customized container home.</p>

	<p>Email us today with a convenient call back time and a senior company director will contact you (no high pressure salesperson) for any information or questions.</p>

	<p>We are a small, but well established manufacturing US Company, with associates who look forward to supplying you a quality product.</p>

	<p>As a valued customer, with a Factory direct sale, you will have access to discuss options with a knowledgeable, experienced consultant.</p>
