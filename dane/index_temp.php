                <h2>Welcome to Custom Container Homes</h2>
                                
                <p>There is a rapidly growing trend, worldwide, in which people are downsizing their living space. There are a number of reasons, from significantly lower building costs, to a simpler lifestyle, or to a more efficient use of space.</p>
                
                <p>At Custom Container Homes, we specialize in low cost custom kits that convert shipping containers into homes, offices, and cabins.</p>
                
                <p>We have several basic plans, from a single basic container, to multiple containers side by side.</p>
                <p>Our specialty in container homes is our modular concept â€” offering a kitchen, bathroom, or bedroom that slide out upon installation, increasing the square footage.</p>
                
                <p>You have the freedom to design your own floor plan tailored to your specific needs. There are a variety of choices.</p>

				<p>Based in Northern Arizona, there are several freight options to most locations. As containers, they are transportable without the need for permits, and they are road legal at 8 feet wide.</p>


				<h3>Why use shipping containers?</h3>
                
                <ul>
                	<li>
                		<p>They are strong, steel, and "eco" green.</p>
 					</li>
                    
                    <li>
                    	<p>An expensive concrete slab is not required.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                    	<p>You get steel building material for much less than for a similar wood framed home.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                    	<p>Enjoy the industrial look or enhance them with sidings of your choice.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                    	<p>Container homes are perfect for today's varied locations.</p>
                    </li>
                        
                </ul>

				<h3>We are competitive.</h3>

				<p>We keep the cost of converting affordable by selling them as kits in several stages of completion, or as a finished, customized container home.</p>

				<p>Email us today with a convenient call-back time and a senior company director will contact you (no high pressure salesperson) for any information or questions.</p>

				<p>We are a small, but well established U.S. manufacturing company, with associates who look forward to supplying you with a quality product.</p> 

				<p>As a valued customer, with a factory direct sale, you will have access to discuss options with a knowledgeable, experienced consultant.</p>
